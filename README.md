# Lab 10: Explainability with Alibi
In this lab, you'll learn about the Alibi Explain library and implement global and local explanations of tabular and image classification models.

Alibi Explain is an open source Python library aimed at machine learning model inspection and interpretation. The focus of the library is to provide high-quality implementations of black-box, white-box, local and global explanation methods for classification and regression models.

Complete all the Deliverables mentioned below and show it to a TA for credit.

## Deliverables
- Finish all the TODOs in Section 2
- Generate PD Plots. Discuss your findings about model performance with the TA and answer Q1, Q2, and Q3:
     - Q1: Which features have higher importance in the prediction? (Section 2.1)
     - Q2: What can you conclude with the PD plots? (Section 2.2)
     - Q3: Discuss with the TA the results (heatmaps). (Section 2.2)
- Show final results  about the Anchor parameters and discuss them with the TA.

## Getting Started
